Instruction for running the programme:-
  - First open juypter notebook programme.
  - Browse to the location containing folder with name Project_1-Part2 and open any below mentioned Juypter notebook files.

Note:- Please note that the folders containing 4 different type of images folders should be placed inside a folder named Dataset.
Also all the juypter notebooks and Dataset folders should be inside the same folder,so that the helper method will able to access all the images and convert it into numpy array 

The contents of this project folder are:-

1) Dataset:- This folder contain 4 folders containing images of 4 different types of fruits (avacado,oranges,pineapple and strawberries) selected for image analysis. In each folder,20 images of same type of fruit are available.
2) Image Analysis_SVM.ipynb:- This juypter notebook  contains implementation of SVM model for image analysis task.
3) Image_Analysis_NeuralNetwork.ipynb:- This juypter notebook contains implementation of Neural Network model for image analysis task.
4) Image_Analysis_RandomForest.ipynb:- This juypter notebook contains implementation of Random Forest model for image analysis task.
5) Part2_ProjectReport_Data Science:- This is project report document.
